<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp taco seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 Tbsp dried minced onions <em>(or 1 tsp onion powder)</em></li>
    <li>1 cup TVP (textured vegetable protein)</li>
    <li>1 (15 oz) can black beans <em>(drained)</em></li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>6 corn tortillas</li>
    <li>Topppings: <em>Avocado, cilantro, salsa, limes, red onions, etc., all optional</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring the water, taco seasoning, and onion to a boil. Add the TVP and reduce heat to low. Allow the TVP to absorb the liquid, and then add the drained black beans.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook on low heat, stirring often, until the tortillas are ready – be mindful to not let the filling scorch on the bottom of the pot. Check for seasoning – add salt if needed (taco seasonings all have different salt contents so use your judgment on how much to add).</li>
    <li>Heat up the tortillas in a pan with some oil, on a grill, or over your stove burner.</li>
    <li>Remove the filling from the heat and build your tacos using your favorite toppings.
