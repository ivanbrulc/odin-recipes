    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cut block of tofu into 1/2-inch to 1-inch cubes <em>(see note)</em>. Take a paper towel and press the cubes gently to remove as much water as you can.</li>

        <li>Spread the tofu out onto a baking sheet and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through with a set of tongs.</li>
        <li>While the tofu is in the oven, prepare the honey garlic sauce on the stove. Start by heating up sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium. Add minced garlic and saut√© for a couple minutes.</li>
        <li>Then, add in honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and cornstarch slurry. Bring ingredients to a boil and stir continuously for about 30-60 seconds as the sauce thickens. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Remove the tofu from the oven and toss in the honey garlic sauce. Serve with sides (see notes for ideas) and add optional garnish as desired. Enjoy immediately!</li>
